## Development Workflow

### Professional Workflow (as used by top companies)

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use `main` for production-ready code.
   - Use `develop` for ongoing development.
   - Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`
   - Bugfix branches: `bugfix/<description>`
   - Release branches: `release/<version>`

2. **Code Reviews**
   - All code changes go through Pull Requests (PRs).
   - At least one peer review is required before merging.
   - Use PR templates and link related issues.

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated tests and linting run on every PR.
   - Build must pass before merging.

4. **Issue Tracking**
   - Use GitHub Issues or Jira for task management.
   - Features, bugs, and improvements are tracked as tickets.

5. **Documentation**
   - All components and utilities are documented.
   - README and in-code comments are kept up to date.

6. **Release Management**
   - Releases are tagged and changelogs are maintained.
   - Hotfixes are merged back into `main` and `develop`.

## Navigation Guide

- **Navbar:**  
  - Located at the top of the app, includes navigation links, cart icon, and user avatar.
  - The cart icon displays a badge with the number of items added.

- **Product Gallery:**  
  - Main area displays the featured product image and thumbnails.
  - Clicking a thumbnail updates the main image.
  - Clicking the main image opens a modal with image navigation.

- **Cart Interaction:**  
  - Use plus/minus buttons to select quantity.
  - Click "Add to cart" to update the cart badge in the navbar.
  - The badge only appears when at least one item is added.

- **Modal:**  
  - Opens when the main product image is clicked.
  - Use chevron buttons to navigate images.
  - Click the close button or outside the modal to close.

---

## Implemented Features

- Responsive layout with Chakra UI Grid.
- Product image gallery with modal preview.
- Quantity selector with plus/minus buttons.
- Add to cart functionality with badge indicator.
- Navbar with navigation links, cart, and avatar.
- Modular, reusable components.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- Professional code organization and naming conventions.

## Current Stage & Next Steps

### **Current Stage**
- Core UI and product gallery are implemented.
- Cart badge updates with selected quantity.
- Modal image viewer is functional.
- Codebase is modular and ready for expansion.

### **Next Steps**
1. **Cart Functionality**
   - Implement a cart drawer or page to view and manage cart items.
   - Allow removal and quantity adjustment from the cart.

2. **Product Data**
   - Integrate with a backend or mock API for dynamic product data.
   - Add product details, pricing, and inventory management.

3. **User Authentication**
   - Add login/register functionality.
   - Persist cart and user data.

4. **Checkout Flow**
   - Implement checkout and payment integration.
   - Order summary and confirmation.

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit and integration tests.
   - Set up CI for automated testing.

6. **Accessibility & Performance**
   - Audit and improve accessibility.
   - Optimize images and code for performance.

7. **Deployment**
   - Prepare for deployment (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
   - Set up environment variables and secrets.

## Best Practices & Professional Workflow

- **Component Reusability:** All UI elements are modular and reusable.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout for reliability.
- **State Management:** State is lifted to the appropriate parent; Context or Redux can be introduced as the app grows.
- **Styling:** Chakra UI ensures consistent, themeable styling.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- **Testing:** Write tests for all components and business logic.
- **Code Reviews:** All changes are peer-reviewed before merging.
- **Documentation:** Keep this documentation and in-code comments up to date.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Write clear, concise commit messages.
3. Ensure all code passes linting and tests.
4. Open a Pull Request and request review.
5. Respond to feedback and make necessary changes.

---

## Other Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Add user-friendly error messages for failed actions.
- **Loading States:** Show spinners or skeletons during async operations.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure all features work on mobile devices.
- **Security:** Sanitize user input and secure API endpoints.
- **Analytics:** Integrate analytics for user behavior tracking.
